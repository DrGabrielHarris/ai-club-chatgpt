Great phone,5,"I upgraded to the iPhone 16 Pro 512 GB from a iPhone Mini that was coming to the end of battery life.

I went with this model in anticipation of Apple Intelligence which is due for roll out in the next 6mths.

Operationally, there arent many differences between previous models but the battery life is much better and its really fast - has no problems with multiple apps etc.

Only this colour was available at the time of order in the model / spec I wanted; otherwise Id have gone for grey or black. But this is a minor detail and is irrelevant as Ive put a cover on it. Its not an unpleasant colour anyway.

I like the new camera button - makes for easy zoom and operation. The camera is great.

I bought a cover that came with camera lens covers, but without that Id be worried about damaging them from drops as they sit quite proud above the back, so Id recommend a good case specifically for this reason as Im not sure how durable they are.

I had a Pro before the Mini so knew it would be bigger but Id forgotten how big Ive got quite long fingers so I can use it with one hand, but women or teens with smaller hands may struggle a little. My case is quite robust so that adds a little size too.

Overall Id recommend this phone. When I purchased, it was at a reasonable price and I couldnt find it cheaper elsewhere."
Worth the upgrade,5,"Very good phone. The delivery driver had to take a code on delivery to prove itd actually been given to me which I think is very smart on Amazons part. It came well packaged and completely undamaged.

Its a good and fast phone was lots of storage. Its very easy to set up from another iPhone too (takes about 10 minutes to upload data from the cloud).
However, it doesnt currently have Apple intelligence on it. Apple isnt releasing that until around December 2024, despite Apple intelligence being the primary selling point (so probably not worth the upgrade if you already have an iPhone 15 but worth it for any below).
Overall the design is sleek, the camera is next level and the action button being customisable is a nice touch.
Worth the money."
Faulty phone,1,"The iPhone supplied was not suitable for use in the uk. Numerous SIM cards were inserted and d is not work.
I will never buy anything electronic from Amazon again"
A Major Upgrade from the 12 with Smooth Display and Promising Features,4,"I recently upgraded from the iPhone 12 to the Apple iPhone 16 Pro, and theres definitely a noticeable improvement. For me, the standout feature is the 120Hz display. Going from 60Hz to 120Hz feels like a huge upgrade and gives the phone a much more premium feel. The screen, battery life, and overall performance are all better than my previous phone, and the new titanium feel of the device adds to that premium experience. The new features are definitely a step up.

The battery life is a major improvement. Throughout the day, by the time I reach the end of it, Ive only used less than half of the battery, compared to my iPhone 12, which would sometimes be dead by the end of the day. It's been a big relief not to worry about charging multiple times a day anymore.

I did consider upgrading to the iPhone 15 Pro, but I decided to wait for the 16, and after trying both, Id say the main differences are the camera control and the promised Apple intelligence. The new Pro models, with the slightly larger display, feel great in hand. I briefly tried the 15 Pro, and while I wanted a larger phone, I didnt want the Pro Max. The 6.3-inch size of the 16 Pro is the perfect sweet spot for me.

As for the camera, Im not someone who takes super detailed photos, but the 4K 120fps video quality is impressive. However, be aware that these videos take up a lot of storage space, so if you plan on recording in 4K 120fps frequently, you might want an external drive or iCloud storage to avoid filling up your phone too quickly.

Would I recommend upgrading from the iPhone 12? It depends on what youre looking for. If youre happy with your current phone, its not absolutely necessary to upgrade, but personally, I enjoy the dynamic island, the larger screen, and the smoother 120Hz display. I plan on keeping the iPhone 16 Pro for the next 4 years, just like I did with my previous phone. However, we might be getting sold on the promise of Apple intelligence making this phone even bettertime will tell."
iPhone 16 Pro - 256GB.,5,"The iPhone 16 Pro has been a great upgrade option for me, combining a sleek design and built for the new Apple Intelligence features due to be released.

The first thing I did notice is the new display - it feels crisp, vibrant. The improved refresh rate makes everything from scrolling to gaming feel incredibly smooth.

Performance-wise, the new A18 chip delivers decent speeds, effortlessly handling multitasking and demanding apps - gaming on my iPhone feels a lot smoother and the phone itself just feels a lot faster compared to my old iPhone 13 Pro Max.

The battery life has also seen a decent boost, easily lasting a full day even with heavy use - I often have my phone on low power mode, and still runs decently and the battery has lasted way over 24 hours despite using it often.

The camera system, always a standout feature for the Pro models, has been further refined.

The improved low-light performance is actually insane to be honest, and along with the new AI-enhanced photography tools, it allows for stunning photos and videos in any condition.

The new camera button on the iPhone 16 Pro is actually incredibly useful and it can be customised to open various apps - it felt a little weird at first and the button felt in the way, but I got used to it after a day or so.

The only downside to be honest, is that the outer black titanium case feels plasticky oddly - I think it feels rather cheap, but I have my phone in a Spigen hybrid case, so it doesnt bother me that much.

This iPhone 16 Pro - comes with the new Apple braided USB-C cable and a sim pin.

Unfortunately, and rather disappointingly - Apple has decided to remove the stickers. Sad times.

Overall, the iPhone 16 Pro is a powerhouse device that pushes the boundaries of what a smartphone can do - I highly recommend the iPhone 16 Pro!"
Will never not love the iPhone,5,"I upgraded from the 11pro, so the difference is quite dramatic for me. Speed, screen and cameras are a definite upgrade and I love that theyve circled back to the more square design. I love the more squat size compared to Samsung and others as it feels better in my hands personally. The new scrolling button is a great new feature and the fact that I can add any function to the side button is fab. Like-for-like, this is great value for money in my books."
Wow best iphone ever,5,This is the best iphone I've had so far. It's feathers for gaming and other uses
Apple intelligence is scam,4,Not worthy update
Shipping and packaging are not good,4,The product is genuine but Amazon charges 4.99 for shipping and packaging even though the packing was damaged
Nice,4,Its very high quality as its always been with iPhone but not much difference of iPhone 15 and no AI features yet
4stars just because Im Unhappy with how is packaged,4,"Great phone, I just received today after a week but I didnt like it how is package. They put the box in a cardboard envelope without any wrapping bubble or something extra to protect your phone"
Satisfied upgrade from a 12 Pro,5,"I was reluctant to upgrade from my 12 Pro due to the minimal changes over the versions but a charger port issue made me choose it over a repair. At first, I wasnt sure that I made the right choice but as I always use my phones without cases, Im loving the smooth screen edge and along with the smaller bezel, using the phone is a dream and definitely the selling point for me. I need to give it more time to figure out battery performance but so far its a noticeable improvement. I hope to get used to the new camera button but so far I havent needed it."
First,4,"beautiful phone, but camera control button is quite pointless as using on screen options is more convenient. Better to get 15 pro and youll still be able to use apple intelligence"
Most incomplete product Apple ever released,3,Its a iPhone ok mostly does what other iPhones do. But without the features shown on release videos for Apple AI its a incomplete product.
The phones were perfect,5,"Quick delivery, and the phones arrived in perfect shape"
Love it,5,Made the switch from being long time Samsung. Transition was much easier than I thought and I don't regret it. So much more premium build. No complaints after around a month
GREAT PHONE,5,GREAT UPGRADE AND GOOD VALUE
I personally love it,5,"I haven't upgraded my phone since Iphone 11, I'm very much if it's broken I aint fixing or changing it. Sadly that's exactly what occurred and I was forced to upgrade and I'm genuinely pleasantly surprised as from the 11 to now it feels like a completely new phone to me personally. The camera quality and the overall speed of the phone is what I'm truly enjoying. Perhaps sheeple the trick is to not buy new ones constantly wait 5/7 years"
Brilliant service from snazon,5,We al know the iPhone is iconic and an excellent thing. I ordered and paid for the phone for next day delivery in 25 seconds. Beat that !
Nice phone,5,"Not worth upgrading to but coming to iPhone for the first time, its a nice phone"
iPhone 16 pro 256gb,5,"Upgraded from 14 pro so for me its just the action button and the new camera button I a change . Phone feels lighter.
Thought I might be waiting long for it to arrive but got it in the morning"
Happy with Amazon but disappointed with apple,2,"I wouldnt recommend getting this for phone for solely two reasons. The battery life is horrible and so disappointing. I upgraded because my iPhone 13 battery was dying. However after spending £1,099 I expected the battery to atleast last a day. In reality I had to charge it twice a day with minimum usage. Literally my phone could be sitting idle and the battery was running out. It is not worth the upgrade. Save your money"
Not Top edge performance,2,Not Okay
1000% better than iPhone 14 Pro Max,5,"I purchased the iPhone 16 Pro Max through EE on my upgrade as I do every 2 years on Launch unfortunately it seems the Pro Max was the far superior option for everyone nobody seems to of chosen the Pro version this year, but this year I can definitely say Apple have done wonders the camara, the feel, the OLED display whoever says its not worth upgrading from the 15 Pro max then they are wrong, far wrong its outstanding battery performance lasts me a day of constantly flicking through YT shorts where my 14 Pro max would last only from 6.30am till past 12 midday at most but this it lasts literally all day on full brightness too, so dont wait if you see the Pro Max available I seriously think you should purchase it, the Pro version I say would easily suit someone who is a 7-6pm work schedule your battery will never fail and last 2 possibly 3 full days

Purchase it on the plastic apple or Amazon they all have a return policy time so if your not convinced just try it I promise you wont regret it best iPhone ever designed

I purchased the IPhone 16 Pro max in Titanium white with 1TB storage unfortunately Amazon doesnt have them in stock so left a review on the Pro page I also purchased it through my carrier EE and they do accept plastic sims or eSIM whichever s"
Great screen and battery life,5,Held out for the 256gb pro - not disappointed. The increase in size is just right as a max is too big. Battery is great as is the camera . Screen is next level and sharp. Very pleased
All hype no substance,3,"Same old same old. Superficial updates, most people will not notice anything different in their daily use.

The screen resolution is the exact same only has more pixels because its 6.9 inches , the camera is the exact same , the design is the exact same , the performance just has one extra GPU core 6 cores instead of 5 cores , only AI features and the capture button. If you want AI just download ChatGPT and pay a subscription . Apple is using ChatGPT for their AI anyway , The capture button is such a gimmick by the time you adjust the camera settings using that and press the button you miss the shot and you wasted 2 minutes taking the pic when you can just swipe right from the home screen and press the camera button and adjust the settings within the camera app. But if you want to drop another £1200 because its slightly bigger go ahead.
Dont believe YouTubers and content creators saying this is a huge upgrade its not, compare the specs."
